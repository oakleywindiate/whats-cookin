# What's Cookin'?

## Overview

In the mood to cook, but don't know what to make? What's Cookin is an application which allows users to access a recipe repository. Users can search recipes based on name or type of meal, and add those recipes either to a list of favorites or to a list of recipes to cook.

This application was created by Nikki Balmoori, Rachel Hill and Oakley Windiate during our second module of the Front-End Engineering program at Turing School of Software & Design. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/whats-cookin-part-one.html).

## How to Use

To access the application locally:
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- `cd` into the application
- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies
- Run `npm start` to run the local server to see the HTML page
  - Paste `http://localhost:8080/` into your browser to view the HTML page
  - If you need to stop running the local server, run `Control + C`
- To view tests, run `npm test`

## Application in Action
- View a list of all recipes, click on a recipe of interest, and favorite a recipe from the main page.
